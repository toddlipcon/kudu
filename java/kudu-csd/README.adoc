=== Changes to metric definitions

When changing the definitions of existing metrics in the Kudu CSD, it may
also be necessary to change them in the forked (older) CSDs. This is because
CM treats multiple instances of a metric with the same name as the same
logical metric, and expects them to match across all CSDs. If there's any
difference, CM will throw out the metric from all CSDs.

This requirement applies to _at least_ the following kinds of changes:

1. Conversion from a counter to a gauge (or vice versa).
2. Change in the metric's label.
3. Change in the metric's numeratorUnit.
