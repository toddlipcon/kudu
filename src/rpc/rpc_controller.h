// Controller for managing properties of a single RPC call, on the client side.
//
// An RpcController maps to exactly one call and is not thread-safe. The client
// may use this class prior to sending an RPC in order to set properties such
// as the call's timeout.
//
// After the call has been sent (e.g using Proxy::AsyncRequest()) the user
// may invoke methods on the RpcController object in order to probe the status
// of the call.

  // A call is finished if the server has responded, or if the call
  // has timed out.

  // Return the current status of a call.
  //
  // A call is "OK" status until it finishes, at which point it may
  // either remain in "OK" status (if the call was successful), or
  // change to an error status. Error status indicates that there was
  // some RPC-layer issue with making the call, for example, one of:
  //
  // * failed to establish a connection to the server
  // * the server was too busy to handle the request
  // * the server was unable to interpret the request (eg due to a version
  //   mismatch)
  // * a network error occurred which caused the connection to be torn
  //   down
  // * the call timed out

  // Set the timeout for the call to be made with this RPC controller.
  //
  // The configured timeout applies to the entire time period between
  // the AsyncRequest() method call and getting a response. For example,
  // if it takes too long to establish a connection to the remote host,
  // or to DNS-resolve the remote host, those will be accounted as part
  // of the timeout period.
  //
  // Timeouts must be set prior to making the request -- the timeout may
  // not currently be adjusted for an already-sent call.

  // (not recommended!)
